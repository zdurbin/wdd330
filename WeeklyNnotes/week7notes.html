	<p>Fetch API is a global method that has one mandatory argument, typically is the URL of the resource you wish to get. 
Written as: 
fetch(‘https://example.come/data’)
	.then (// code that handles the response)
	.catch(// code that runs if the server returns an error)
The response interface deals with an object that was returned successfully. An example of how this is written:
Fetch(url)
.then((response) => {
	If(response.ok) {
		Return response;
	 }
	Throw Error(response.statusText);
})
.then ( response => //do something with the response)
.catch( error => console.log (‘There was an error’) )
Other properties of the response object:
•	Headers- a header object
•	url- a string containing the url 
•	redirected- a Boolean value that specifies if the response is the result of a redirect
•	type- a string value of basic, cors, error, or opaque
