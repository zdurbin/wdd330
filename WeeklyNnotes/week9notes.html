	<p>So, for this week in my notes section, I went through and worked the team activity and tried to figure out how to get the stretch goals completed. Currently, I still do not have the goals working but I am confident that I can complete the activity. It has been challenging this week and I think that I am missing just a very simple task in my function to get the key button to move down, and once I have it to move then it would just be a matter of setting the position change to reset itself. <a href="week9notes/">week 9 notes</a>
