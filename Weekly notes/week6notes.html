	<p>This week was spent recreating the todo list that I lost at the end of week 5. It served as a strong reminder to always back up my files in mulitple places so that I do not lose work that I have already completed. fortunately for me, I was able to remember most of the css and html that I had created to recreate it. Where I struggled was recreating the javascript, but in the process of recreating it, and doing further research, I feel that I was able to understand the concepts better and present a passable solution to the challenge. </p>
