    <p>This week my notes came from the reading itself. I found that the summery really helped drive home the points that I need to remember.
    <ul>
        <li>Bugs are going to happen. It is impossible to write code perfect on the first try and that is okay. Just keep checking your work as you work through it and you will find them.</li>

        <li>The 'use strict' string can be used in JS to create a better quality of code.</li>

        <li>Use linting tools to help ensure that your code follows best practices and conventions.</li>

        <li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement- research this more for future reference.</li>

        <li>research more on the try, catch, and finally statements and their functionality.</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
